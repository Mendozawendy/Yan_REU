Overview multiple flux to perform lightcurve using pltly 

Viable stars are stars that change their brightness over time. 
Here we present a photometric study of images obtained with the Cristina Torres Memorial Observatory (CTMO), an optical telescope in Resaca de la Palma, Brownsville, Texas.
Our primary goal is to identify and monitor changes in the brightness of stars using relative photometry. 
Through a user-friendly web application interactive graphs, we measure each star's light.
Cataloging stars and creating aperture light curves reveal correct brightness, leading to the discovery of new variable stars in the field of view and a list for follow-up studies. â€‹

The flux datasets were saved in a CSV file and integrated into a web application developed using Python
